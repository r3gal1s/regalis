    <p>The Adult Ward felt like a different universe altogether.</p>

<p>We’d named it <strong>Pyin Oo Lwin House</strong>, after the quiet hill town where my family and I had done our first Buddhist retreat together.</p>

<p>It was the place where we had first learned how to sit still — how to breathe not just to survive, but to arrive.</p>

<p>To listen to silence without trying to fill it. To be with discomfort without trying to outrun it. That’s what we wanted this ward to feel like.</p>

<p>Not just a place of healing, but a place of remembering. Of returning.</p>

<p>The colors here were grounding — warm ochres, gentle yellows, earthy browns that made the white coats feel less like uniforms and more like aprons worn with care.</p>

<p>It didn’t feel sterile. It didn’t feel overwhelming. It felt like the kitchen of someone you love — where there’s always a place to sit, always a cup of tea waiting, always the smell of something good lingering in the air.</p>

<p>There were soft chairs in the waiting room, real ones, the kind that sighed when you sank into them. And there was food — actual, fragrant, soulful food.</p>

<p>Bowls of mohinga steaming on side tables. Fried tofu that someone’s grandmother had brought in with extra chili on the side. Tea leaf salad so tangy and crunchy you could hear the texture in the air. Someone’s uncle handing out samosas with one hand while balancing a sleeping toddler on his shoulder. A cousin running back from the pharmacy. A stranger being offered a seat like they were family.</p>

<p>I was halfway through my rounds when I heard someone humming.</p>

<p>Not a tune I recognized — no lyrics, no melody really — just a soft, unhurried sound, like sunlight translated into breath. It floated down the corridor, light and aimless, curling around the corners of Pyin Oo Lwin House like incense smoke. It wasn’t the kind of sound you usually heard in hospitals, where even joy is often whispered. But then again, nothing about this place had ever been typical.</p>

<p>There, sitting in the window seat with one leg tucked under his longyi and the other swinging gently off the edge, was U Min. He had a notebook resting on his lap, a ballpoint pen in his hand, and a pair of reading glasses teetering dangerously on the tip of his nose. His nasal cannula was half off, the line looped around his arm with the casual elegance of someone who had clearly made peace with it.</p>

<p>He didn’t look up when I entered — just kept humming and scribbling into his notebook.</p>

<p>“Good morning, U Khant Min,” I said, smiling as I stepped into the light of his room. “You need to keep this on,” I added gently, adjusting his nasal cannula and checking the pulse oximeter clipped to his finger.</p>

<p>Without glancing up from his notebook, he replied, “Dr. Tharapwhu, do you know how many tiles are on your floor?”</p>

<p>I blinked. “Excuse me?”</p>

<p>“The floor,” he said, gesturing with his pen toward the hallway behind me. “Between the nurse’s station and this window. I’ve been counting. I think it’s 427. But I keep losing track when the samosa guy comes.”</p>

<p>I smiled. Of course he was counting tiles.</p>

<p>Before the stroke, U Khant Min had been a construction manager — the kind of man who could step into a space and immediately see its skeleton. He’d walk into a bare room and see not just what it was, but what it could be — where the beams should go, where the windows should face for the best light, how the rain would sound on the roof. He used to tell me, “You can’t trust a ceiling unless you’ve stood under it during the storm — or better yet, built it yourself.”</p>

<p>The job might’ve left him. But I don’t think it ever really let him go.</p>

<p>I stifled a laugh. “Is this part of your recovery plan?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely,” he said solemnly. “That and trying to beat Daw Khin Khin at poker. Which, by the way, is impossible. That woman has the soul of a hustler.”</p>

<p>He finally looked up at me, his eyes twinkling with mischief. There was something about U Min that reminded me of my grandfather, the same kind of quiet defiance against age, the same way he made you feel like every moment with him was a story in the making. The full head of black hair didn’t help either.</p>

<p>“I’m also making a crossword puzzle,” he added, tapping his pen against the notebook. “But I need a word for ‘a young doctor who never remembers to eat lunch.’ Ten letters. Starts with ‘M.’”</p>

<p>I raised an eyebrow. “That’s oddly specific.”</p>

<p>“I call them like I see them,” he said, with mock seriousness. “I saw you sprint past the tea table twice this morning. You even dodged my daughter’s samosas. That’s not natural.”</p>

<p>I laughed, easing into the chair beside him. “I’m building up my immunity to carbs.”</p>

<p>He gave me a look over his glasses. “You’re not in a battle, Doctor Tun. You’re in a hospital. A very well-fed one.”</p>

<p>The two of us bathed in warm light from the window, the sounds of the ward quietly pulsing around us. Nurses walked past, not rushing, just moving with that grounded, deliberate rhythm we’d cultivated here. Somewhere, someone’s auntie was reciting a prayer out loud, soft and steady. The smell of fried shallots lingered in the air, probably from the volunteer kitchen two floors down.</p>

<p>“You know,” he said after a pause, his voice gentler now, “this place doesn’t feel like a hospital.”</p>

<p>I turned to look at him.</p>

<p>“It feels like someone’s home,” he said. “Like the kind of place you take off your shoes in without thinking. Where someone always hands you tea without asking if you want it. And you,” he pointed his pen at me, “you feel like the niece who left for something big and came back wearing a white coat and too much responsibility.”</p>

<p>My throat tightened, just a little. He meant it lightly, but there was a truth under it — a truth I hadn’t quite put into words before. How this whole hospital, from its name to its walls to the very way we moved inside it, was a love letter to where I’d come from. To family. To all the people who’d raised me, taught me, fed me, and quietly believed I would build something worth returning to.</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best to live up to the family name,” I said, quietly.</p>

<p>He nodded. “And eat your lunch.”</p>

<p>I laughed again — a real, full laugh this time — and stood to continue my rounds.</p>

<p>As I reached the doorway, he called out behind me, “Oh, and Doctor?”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“I’m putting your name in the crossword.”</p>

<p>“Oh really? What’s the clue?”</p>

<p>He grinned. “‘Wearer of stubbornness, heart like a rice pot — always full.’ Seven letters. Starts with M.”</p>

<p>I rolled my eyes. “That’s at least two clues.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll just have to live up to all of them.”</p>

<p>This wasn’t just a ward where people came to get better. It was a place where people came to be seen. To be heard. To be held, if only by the gentleness of the space around them.</p>

<p>Pyin Oo Lwin House didn’t just treat patients. It treated people. And maybe, in a world that often forgets to do so, that’s the most radical thing a hospital can be.</p>
