  <h1>Global health is just neo-colonialism with a better PR team</h1>
  <div class="date">June 5, 2025</div>

  <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/7r6PigmGzlB3YPB7wvBBbi?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

  <p>What it protects is Western power, prestige, and profit. Let’s call it what it is: the aid industry is the empire, resurrected in a Patagonia vest, polished with hashtags, and propped up by self-congratulatory donors.</p>

  <p>If justice guided our spending, the Central African Republic would gleam with glass-windowed hospitals. Chad’s clinics would be cooled by solar panels, its fridges stocked with vaccines, its health workers paid on time and in full. In South Sudan, roads would reach the villages, not stop at the outskirts. There would be plumbing, power, and the quiet, mundane luxury of regular care.</p>

  <p><strong>The 10/90 gap says it all:</strong> less than 10% of health research funding goes toward diseases that cause 90% of preventable deaths. Mostly in poor, formerly colonized countries. Why? Because those deaths don’t generate returns. They’re dying because their deaths don’t trend. No oil, no crops, no exploitable infrastructure left. Just lives, inconveniently unprofitable.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in sub-Saharan Africa—where nearly a quarter of the world’s disease burden lives—only a single percent of the world’s health funding finds its way. Not enough to electrify a maternity ward. Not enough to stock the pharmacy past Thursday. Not enough to fix the roof above the birthing bed.</p>

  <p>Yet there is always enough for flights. Always enough for panels. Always enough for a keynote on “empowering local voices” spoken by someone who has never stood in line at the clinic when the medicine runs out.</p>

  <p>We’ve built an entire industry where white graduates from Ivy League schools can fly first-class into countries whose names they can’t pronounce, take a selfie with a child they’ll never speak to again, add “impact” to their LinkedIn bio, and then fly back to give a keynote on “local empowerment.” The next morning, they’ll sip ethically sourced espresso at Davos and pitch a new idea for “sustainable transformation” to a billionaire with a Messiah complex.</p>

  <p>The clinic still doesn’t have electricity like 60% of sub-Saharan health centers still don’t. The medicine still runs out before the week ends. And the kid from the photo? Still sick. Still waiting.</p>

  <p>You call this “partnership”? That’s rich. It’s like a ventriloquist calling the puppet a co-host.</p>

  <p>Only 11% of global health journal editors are women from low- and middle-income countries. Only 4% hold leadership roles. Imagine a women’s rights movement run entirely by men. Or a climate movement led by oil executives.</p>

  <p><em>Oh wait—welcome to global health.</em></p>

  <p>And when locals are allowed in the room, it’s usually to serve drinks, sweep up, or if they’re lucky, offer a heartfelt anecdote that can be edited into a donor reel. Their voices are erased, sanitized, turned into slogans by NGOs who learned more Swahili from The Lion King than from community members.</p>

  <p>These countries wouldn’t need “aid” if they hadn’t been bled dry, looted, enslaved, dissected, and hollowed out, by centuries of white greed sanctified by the Bible and enforced at gunpoint.</p>

  <p>There were kingdoms in Mali and Songhai that housed libraries while Europe was still burning “witches.” There were irrigation systems in Zimbabwe, bronze sculptures in Benin, urban planning in Mohenjo-Daro, surgical practices in Timbuktu, trade networks in the Swahili coast.</p>

  <p>And still they ask: <em>“Well, what do you expect us to do? Undo colonization?”</em></p>

  <p>No. We expect you to stop pretending it ended.</p>

  <p>The maps are no longer colored pink for empire, but the power lines remain: in language, in currency, in law, in the direction of the money. They took the gold from Ghana, the rubber from Congo, the diamonds from South Africa. They took twenty million lives from West Africa’s shores, chained and silenced, sold as ballast for Western wealth.</p>

  <p>And then they left. They left behind borders that made no sense, armies they trained, legal systems in foreign tongues, and health systems too broken to stand on their own.</p>

  <p>They call it partnership, but only one hand signs the contract. They call it capacity-building, but only one voice holds the mic. They say “shared solutions,” but only one side gets paid.</p>

  <p>But we have decided, somehow, that philanthropy erases history. That white guilt plus market logic equals justice. That if the West pays for a few vaccines, it can forget the coups, the plantations, the patent wars, the IMF loans that gutted public health systems.</p>

  <p><strong>But here’s the math they don’t put in the PowerPoint:</strong><br>
  In 2022, net financial flows to developing countries fell by 48%. That same year, 26 nations paid more in debt service than they received in external finance.</p>

  <p><strong>This isn’t generosity. It’s laundered theft.</strong></p>

  <p>Between 2016 and 2021, only 175 health workers returned to their countries after specialist training in the UK—less than 0.2% of those from LMICs. In just the last two years, nearly 20,000 more were recruited. We don’t just extract resources—we extract people. We drain their doctors, then sell them Band-Aids.</p>

  <p>If global health were justice, the nurse in Malawi would not earn $80 a month to deliver babies without light. The midwives in Uganda would not beg for gloves while Harvard graduates bill $800 an hour for “technical advice.”</p>

  <p>And the old empires, Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Portugal, the Netherlands, would publish the ledger. Gold. Rubber. Labor. Blood. Account for it. And start returning what was stolen.</p>

  <p>This isn’t global health. It’s global theater, written in Geneva, performed in Kinshasa, and bankrolled by the same powers that once held the whip and now hold the conference pamphlet.</p>

  <p><strong>But the plot remains unchanged.</strong><br>
  <em>And the protagonist still waits offstage, unheard.</em></p>
