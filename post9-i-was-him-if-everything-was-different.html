<p>The ER.</p>

<p>We called it Ah-nanda Hsaung — The Shelter of Comfort. Not just a ward. Not just a room with beeping machines and hurried steps. It was a threshold — between fear and care, between crisis and calm.</p>

<p>The walls were soft gray-blue — not to chill, but to soothe. A shade you might find on a monastery wall at dusk, after prayers have been said and candles have been lit. A color that slowed your breathing the moment you walked in.</p>

<p>There was always movement here. Gurneys rolling like carts before a pagoda festival, Monitors blinking, Slippers squeaking, A father’s voice rising in worry. A nurse’s hands answering in silence.</p>

<p>But never chaos. Because we built Ah-nanda Hsaung to be fast without fear. Urgent, but never unkind.</p>

<p>At the far end of the hallway sat our Grief Rooms. Low lighting. Floor mats and woven blankets instead of cold chairs. Fresh water. A kettle of tea that never emptied. Here, sorrow was allowed to sit down. To breathe. To be held.</p>

<p>We had prayer corners for every faith. A candle tray for Buddhists. A copy of the Quran near a quiet bench. A small cross. A folded shawl. A space for silence. You didn’t need to ask, The comfort was already waiting.</p>

<p>Our care carts were stocked not just with medical supplies, but with mercy. Longyis for patients who arrived rushed and barefoot. Thanaka and wipes for those who had slept outside hospital gates. Boiled peanuts. Small flasks of strong tea. Not charity. Dignity.</p>

<p>Because here, in Ah-nanda Hsaung, we didn’t strip people down to their chart numbers. We didn’t treat only the wound. We treated the whole human.</p>

<p>We called patients U and Daw, and we meant it. We remembered their village names, their family histories. We asked if they’d eaten, before we asked where it hurt. We offered a warm blanket before a diagnosis.</p>

<p>Trained EMTs from across Myanmar. From Rakhine, from Chin hills, from the Ayeyarwady delta.</p>

<p>Some of them had learned their first aid skills in the back of our mobile clinics, treating flood victims and feverish children. Now they stood tall in scrubs and sneakers, walking confidently through our halls.</p>

<p>We weren’t just building a hospital. We were building a pipeline:<br>
From the village,<br>
To the clinic,<br>
To the sacred frontline of care.</p>

<p>They learned how to check vitals. But also how to read fear. To hold a hand not just to steady it, but to say “We see you.” To whisper: “It’s okay. You’re safe now.” And mean it.</p>

<p>We got the call just before sunset.</p>

<p>One of our mobile clinics had made it out to a remote village in the dry zone — the kind of place you won’t find on most maps. Just a scattering of tin-roof homes and clay stoves, where the only traffic is foot and ox cart, and the only road turns to river every monsoon.</p>

<p>The team had set up under a tamarind tree — blood pressure cuffs on a folding table, a pulse oximeter that only worked if you held it at the perfect angle, the smell of turmeric and dust in the air. That’s where they found him.</p>

<p><strong>Ko Zeya Win.</strong><br>
Thirty years old. My age.<br>
Though he looked older — or maybe just more weathered.</p>

<p>He’d come for a cough. Said it started during the last rainy season. Said it never really went away. His grandmother had insisted he go, after weeks of night sweats, dizziness, and chest pain.</p>

<p>He was tall, but gaunt, all bone and quiet.<br>
His longyi hung loose on his hips.<br>
His hands, long-fingered and calloused, rested over his ribs like they were trying to hold something in.</p>

<p>They ran a quick TB test.<br>
Positive.<br>
But worse — his oxygen levels were already dipping into the 80s, and one side of his chest was moving slower than the other. Signs of pleural effusion, fluid collecting around the lungs.<br>
He couldn’t be treated there. He needed hospital care. Now.</p>

<p>They brought him in as twilight fell — a rough ride, hours on broken roads. He was lying in the back of the van, wrapped in a worn blanket, a packet of betel nut tucked into his shirt pocket like a comfort charm. He had no phone. No ID. No health card. Nothing but a name and the hope that someone would help.</p>

<p>When I saw him for the first time, I felt this strange pause in my chest.</p>

<p>He was me, if everything had been different.<br>
Same age.<br>
Same country.<br>
Same rain and sun and soil in our blood.</p>

<p>But different lives.<br>
I had white coats and education.<br>
He had betel stains and breath that came in short, painful gasps.</p>

<p>We wheeled him into Ah-nanda Hsaung, into Bay 4, where the air was cooler, the lights dimmer, and the sense of urgency hummed just beneath the surface.</p>

<p>They learned how to check vitals. But also how to read fear. To hold a hand not just to steady it, but to say “We see you.” To whisper: “It’s okay. You’re safe now.” And mean it.</p>

<p>That was Ah-nanda Hsaung.</p>

<p>Not just where we saved lungs.<br>
But where we gave names back. Where we met men who never expected care and gave it to them anyway.</p>

<p>Because saving a life is more than stabilizing vitals. It’s saying, without condition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“You belong here.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And meaning it.</p>
