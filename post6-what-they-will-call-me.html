  <p>The morning I opened the hospital doors for the first time, my heels struck the tile with a crisp, echoing rhythm as though each step were announcing something sacred, something long overdue. The air outside still clung to that hushed stillness only dawn can hold — as if the world hadn’t yet decided to stir — and the sky above wore that rare, fleeting blush of pinkish-gold, the kind of light that only lives for a breath or two before surrendering to the brashness of full day.</p>

  <p>I paused at the threshold, standing tall on the warm stone steps. The heat of the ground seeped into the soles of my shoes, a quiet murmur of welcome, as if the earth itself was whispering, <em>You made it</em>.</p>

  <p>And I had.</p>

  <p>I looked up at the building, my building, and for a moment, everything fell silent inside me. Not the kind of silence that comes from emptiness, but the still, brimming kind that comes when something is finally, gloriously complete. It stood there, serene and strong in the new light, its clean lines softened by the morning glow. Wide windows blinked back the sun, and the white facade shimmered faintly, not cold or clinical, but radiant, like a pearl against the sky.</p>

  <p>Above the entrance, those letters gleamed — bold and unmistakable in their defiance of erasure:</p>

  <p><strong>Dr. May Tharaphwu Tun</strong></p>

  <p>Not shortened to something easier for the Western tongue.<br>
  Not hidden behind meaningless initials.<br>
  Not bent or broken to fit into someone else’s idea of what is “professional.”</p>

  <p>It was all there.</p>

  <p>The <strong>May</strong> — the name my parents whispered into the cradle of my first dreams, syllables sweet as badauk flowers in bloom.<br>
  The <strong>Tharaphwu</strong> — the crown, the legacy, the whispered promise passed like incense smoke from grandmother to mother to daughter: to walk tall, to be more than what the world expected, to wear dignity like armor.<br>
  And <strong>Tun</strong> — meaning light — my family name, simple and strong. The name of quiet resilience, of people who rose with the sun and kept rising, even when no one clapped, even when no one saw.</p>

  <p>A tremor of breath passed through me, not fear, not even nerves, but the sheer weight of the moment settling into my chest. Around my neck, the stethoscope hung heavy, like a medal, like a memory. Inside, everything was in place. The charts. The machines. The fresh scent of antiseptic and jasmine from the lobby flowers.</p>

  <p>But outside was where the heartbeat of the day had already begun to drum.</p>

  <p>A line had formed, long before the first shift was due to begin. It spilled down the walkway, wrapped around the corner, and disappeared into the still-shadowed street. It wasn’t loud, or frantic. There was no shouting, no jostling.</p>

  <p>It was quiet.</p>
  <p>It was steady.<br>
  It was full of hope.</p>

  <p>Old men with creased faces and trembling hands rested on canes carved by hand, their longyis fluttering like flags. Women with babies balanced on their hips stood as still as banyan trees, their eyes scanning the entrance like a lighthouse at last in view. And the children danced lightly on their bare feet, some still in their pajamas, faces bright with the belief that anything was possible, that they weren’t just here to be healed, but to belong.</p>

  <p>The doors opened.<br>
  The day began.</p>

  <hr style="margin: 2rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc;"/>

  <p>I stepped inside just as the Pediatrics Ward came to life.</p>

  <p>We called it <strong>Nay Lann</strong> — “The Sunshine Path.”<br>
  And it lived up to its name in every way that mattered.</p>

  <p>The walls were a riot of joy, a living mural where tigers leapt across cotton candy clouds, elephants paraded through jungles of emerald green, and the sun wore a pair of sunglasses and a mischievous grin, as if it too was in on the joke. Light filtered in through tall windows, soft and golden, catching on every color like it was playing a game of its own.</p>

  <p>Laughter floated through the halls, the kind of sound that wraps itself around your ribs and squeezes gently. Giggles echoed like wind chimes caught in a breeze, small voices layered in chaotic harmony.</p>

  <p>A group of kids tore down the corridor after a half-deflated soccer ball, feet pounding, joy in motion. One boy, no taller than my hip, wore a stethoscope so comically oversized it bounced off his knees with every step. The ball veered wildly, due to a touch too many, and spun toward a heart monitor, humming quietly on its cart.</p>

  <p>Before it could connect with four thousand dollars’ worth of fragile tech, I lunged, caught it mid-air.</p>

  <p><em>Silence.</em></p>

  <p>Every child froze with limbs suspended, eyes wide, faces pulled tight in matching expressions of guilt and anticipation. Even the stethoscope stopped swinging.</p>

  <p>I held the ball for a moment. Then I dropped it, megged the fastest child, and tapped it into a corner of their makeshift goal of two shoes with the back of my heel.</p>

  <p><strong>The ward exploded.</strong></p>

  <p>Screams of joy.<br>
  Shock.<br>
  Delight.<br>
  The kind of wild, unfiltered laughter that only children can summon from the center of their chests. They mobbed me in a swarm of high-fives and breathless admiration.</p>

  <p>A nurse leaned against the doorway, arms crossed, shaking her head with a smile that said, <em>You’re a doctor now, you know?</em> But I wasn’t just a doctor. I was them, once.</p>
  <p>And in the most deepest corners of myself, I still am.</p>

  <p>Every room carried its own small world; cartoons whispered from mounted screens, beanbags spilled across cozy corners, shelves stacked with picture books... Video games blinked quietly in one alcove; in another, a make-believe tea party was in session, complete with plastic cookies and surgical masks decorated in glitter.</p>

  <p>But beneath the whimsy, real medicine pulsed.<br>
  Medical equipment stood at the ready; they were softened, not hidden.<br>
  Blood pressure cuffs adorned with stuffed kittens.<br>
  IV poles painted like trees.<br>
  Plastic syringes in shades of orange and purple, given to children to hold, explore, understand so that fear would not be their first feeling.</p>

  <p>Because this place wasn’t about distraction.<br>
  It was about dignity. It was about giving even the smallest patients a sense of safety, of sovereignty. Of self.</p>

  <p>At the nurses’ station, I sat down briefly, adjusting the tablet in my hands, scrolling through the morning notes, blood pressures, meal logs, a few flagged charts that would need a closer look later. I had barely settled into the chair when a small weight pressed into my lap, warm and familiar, as if this moment had been rehearsed many times before.</p>

  <p>She didn’t say a word. Just climbed up like she belonged there, which, in a way, she did.</p>

  <p>An IV snaked from the back of her hand, taped carefully in place, the line trailing to a tiny plastic stroller that rattled slightly with every step. It was filled with her medication, tucked beside a ragged stuffed rabbit and a juice box. Her cheeks were round and full, brushed with pale yellow <em>thanka</em> swatches: a signature touch from one of the older nurses who’d sworn by it since I was a child myself. Her hair was parted into two neat braids, each adorned with butterfly clips in pastel shades of pink and blue, catching the morning light like bits of stained glass.</p>

  <p>As she settled in, I found my hand moving on its own, fingers tracing the ridges of her braids, gently, absently, the way my mother used to do with mine, in the soft hush of late evenings, when the world was quiet and love didn’t need words.</p>

  <p>She looked up at me with eyes that didn’t flinch, didn’t falter.<br>
  Serious as a heartbeat.</p>

  <p>“You’re Dr. Tharaphwu, right?”<br>
  I smiled. “I am.”</p>

  <p>She nodded, as if confirming something she already knew. Then, clear and unwavering:</p>

  <p>“I’m gonna be like you when I grow up. I’m gonna help people.”</p>

  <p>Something sharp bloomed behind my ribs — part ache, part awe. The kind that wells up so suddenly it blinds you. My vision blurred. I blinked — once, then twice — gathering the pieces of myself.</p>

  <p>“No,” I whispered, brushing a stray braid behind her ear.<br>
  “You’re going to be better.”</p>
