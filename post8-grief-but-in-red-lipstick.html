  <p>Down the hall is Sein Shin Ward, named after my grandmother.</p>

  <p>It’s our cancer ward — the one that holds everything from the whisper of an early diagnosis to the full-throated battle of late-stage treatment. Breast. Lung. Colon. Lymphoma. Leukemia. We don’t separate by type here.</p>

<p>Cancer is cancer. Grief is grief. Hope is hope. And every story, no matter how long or short, deserves to be held with the same reverence.</p>

<p>My grandmother, Sein Shin, is still fighting ovarian cancer with the same quiet strength she’s always carried — the kind of fire that warms, not burns. The kind that doesn’t ask to be noticed, but never goes out.</p>

<p>She’s the reason this floor even exists.</p>

<p>There are orchids in every room, just like the ones she used to grow on our old apartment balcony. They lived in chipped pots and cracked bowls, balanced on bamboo shelves she patched together herself. Fragile, delicate things — and yet, they always bloomed. No matter the sun, the storm, the neglect. Resilient in their own quiet language. Just like her.</p>

<p>The lighting is soft and diffused — no harsh fluorescents, no buzzing panels overhead. Instead, golden pools of warmth spill from shaded sconces, casting gentle shadows, turning IV stands and oxygen tanks into something less clinical, more human. Here, even the harsh edges of suffering are softened by intention.</p>

<p>The nurses speak in gentle voices. They know when to crack a joke, and when to hold a hand without saying a word. They know that healing sometimes means silence, sometimes laughter, and often — simply staying in the room a little longer.</p>

<p>The pain charts live on clipboards, sure. But they’re also written on faces.</p>

<p>We notice the slight slouch in a patient’s shoulders before they ever say they’re tired. We hear the pause in a daughter’s voice before she asks, “Is there anything more we can do?” We know which patients like ginger tea, which ones need the blinds open, and which ones are scared of the dark.</p>

<p>We call people by their names — not their diagnosis. We talk to the family, not around them. We bring slippers to cold feet and music to empty silences. We ask, “How are you feeling?” — and we wait for the real answer, not just the rehearsed one.</p>

<p>And through it all, my grandmother’s spirit hums softly beneath the surface, like a heartbeat just under the floorboards. You can feel it in the way someone adjusts a blanket. In the orchids blooming beside every bed.</p>

<p>Room 212 was unusually quiet that morning.</p>

<p>No visitors. No nurses in or out. Just the steady rhythm of the IV pump and the faint rustle of the orchids by the windowsill, petals swaying slightly in the breeze from the ceiling fan.</p>

<p>Daw Nandar, 42, stage III breast cancer. Two weeks into her second round of chemo.</p>

<p>Usually, she was the life of the ward — the one who wore bright lipstick, even on her worst days. The one who brought sticky rice wrapped in banana leaves for the night shift nurses. The one who made the other patients laugh so hard during morning blood draws that half the ward forgot they were being poked.</p>

<p>But today, the lipstick was gone. The tray of food untouched.</p>

<p>And she was staring — not at anything, really — just past the foot of her bed, into a space only she could see.</p>

<p>I knocked softly on the open door anyway. “Permission to enter?” I asked, smiling gently. She didn’t answer, but her eyes flicked toward me, then back to the blank wall. I walked in slowly, not filling the space with questions. Just presence.</p>

<p>After a pause, she said, “Do you know what the hardest part is?” Her voice was dry, papery. The kind of voice that had been rehearsing this line all morning.</p>

<p>I pulled the chair closer and sat down beside her. “What?”</p>

<p>“It’s not the nausea. Not the hair.” She glanced at her reflection in the darkened window. “Not even the fear, really.”</p>

<p>She looked at me, her eyes ringed with exhaustion.</p>

<p>“It’s my daughter. She stopped asking if I’m going to get better. She just asks if I’m coming home in time for her birthday.” My chest ached in that quiet, invisible way it often did in this ward — where the grief was always gentle, but relentless.</p>

<p>“I think she’s trying to protect me,” Daw Nandar whispered. “But she’s only seven. She shouldn’t have to.” I didn’t have a clinical answer for that. There was no dosage for watching your child learn to expect your absence.</p>

<p>So I reached into my coat pocket and pulled out the tiny pink hairclip I kept with me — one my own grandmother had used to fasten my braid on school mornings. Plastic, faded, with the little flower decal nearly rubbed off. I didn’t know why I had it with me that day. I hadn’t touched it in months. But something in me reached for it — maybe instinct, maybe memory.</p>

<p>I placed it gently on the bedside table, next to the untouched bowl of soup and a folded tissue that hadn’t been used.</p>

<p>“She will remember your laughter,” I said softly. “The pink lipstick. The way your voice fills a room. She’ll carry it in ways she won’t even understand for years. That’s what daughters do.”</p>

<p>Daw Nandar looked at the clip, then at me. Her eyes were glassy but steady.</p>

<p>“Do you believe that?” she asked. “I do.”</p>

<p>There was a long silence between us — not heavy, not hollow. Just real. The kind of silence that can only exist between two people who understand something too deep for words.</p>

<p>Then she whispered, “Will you help me put on my lipstick?”</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>From the drawer beside her bed, she pulled out the tube — bright red this time, a bolder shade than usual. Red like flame. Red like certainty.</p>

<p>Her hand trembled as she uncapped it, so I reached forward and took it from her. Carefully, reverently, I traced the familiar lines of her mouth — lips that had comforted, taught, sung lullabies and scolded late homework, lips that still held so much life in them, even now.</p>

<p>She looked into the mirror propped up on the windowsill, blinked once.</p>

<p>“There she is,” she said quietly.</p>

<p>And then — without quite knowing why — I picked up the little pink hairclip and gently fastened it onto the edge of her beanie. The beanie that now covered the head where once there had been a full crown of thick, beautiful hair. The beanie was firetruck red, just like her lipstick.</p>

<p>Just like my grandmother used to do before I left for school — the clip at the end, like punctuation. Like protection.</p>

<p>Daw Nandar reached up and touched it.</p>

<p>She smiled. Not because everything was okay — but because for a moment, something was whole. Something was seen.</p>

<p>In that moment, I realized the hairclip wasn’t just a memory. It was an offering. A blessing passed from one woman to another. From one fighter to the next.</p>
