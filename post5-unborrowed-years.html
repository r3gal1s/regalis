  <p>My hands shake so violently that the integral symbol I’m trying to write looks like a jagged, broken line. Barely legible. My heart races, thundering in my chest. My lungs claw for air, but every breath feels like trying to sip oxygen through a straw.</p>

<p>This is sympathetic dominance—the fight-or-flight system running wild. But there’s no predator, no immediate danger. Just a blank test page and the crushing weight of my own expectations.</p>

<p>Adrenaline-fueled nausea twists my stomach into knots. I stumble out of the exam room and collapse in a bathroom stall, retching over the cold rim of the toilet. In moments like these, my body feels like a puppet jerked around by neurotransmitters firing off like miswired circuits—dopamine, adrenaline, norepinephrine.</p>

<p>Anxiety isn’t inherently bad. At its core, it’s a survival response—an alarm system encoded in our DNA. When you’re in danger, your amygdala sounds the alarm, triggering the hypothalamus to flood your body with stress hormones. Adrenaline sharpens your senses. Cortisol increases your blood sugar, fueling your muscles for action.</p>

<p>The problem is that anxiety doesn’t know the difference between a lion charging at you and a blank exam page. It treats both like life or death.</p>

<p>Then one day, I hit a limit.</p>

<p>It started with a flicker at the edge of my vision, a tiny, darkened blur that I thought would pass. Instead, it spread like spilled ink, dimming the entirety of my left eye. My arms went cold first—then my legs—then the rest of me, as if my body had been unplugged. My knees buckled, and I collapsed, the floor rushing up to meet me.</p>

<p>The doctors explain that I’ve had a transient ischemic attack—a TIA, or “mini-stroke.” When the brain is deprived of oxygen, even briefly, parts of it can temporarily shut down, causing sudden vision loss or numbness. My stress and anxiety have narrowed the blood vessels in my brain, blocking the flow of oxygen to my visual cortex. The hormones that should only kick in during actual emergencies have turned against me, causing vasoconstriction and reducing blood flow to critical parts of my brain.</p>

<p>This wasn’t just a warning sign. It was my body screaming, Enough.</p>

<p>****</p>

<p>I never expected to live past sixteen.</p>

<p>It’s strange, isn’t it? A species driven by survival instincts but capable of overriding them with self-destruction. Human suicide defies the fundamental evolutionary mandate—survival. While animals flee danger, avoiding harm instinctively, humans sabotage their own survival. Some say it’s an evolutionary “flaw,” our abstract minds turning survival mechanisms into sources of suffering. We’re wired to anticipate danger but also to catastrophize, to linger in pain long after the threat is gone. What evolution designed for fleeting emergencies has become a constant, crushing weight, a relic ill-suited for this modern world</p>
<p>It’s April 23, 2023. I’ve survived my first year of college, but I don’t think I can keep going.</p>

<p>Maybe reaching college would change things. Maybe passing that milestone would finally make everything click. But it hasn’t. I’m still here, trapped in a future I never thought I’d have.</p>

<p>I stare at my laptop screen, finger hovering over <em>Submit Petition for Medical Leave</em>. It’s the escape button I’ve dreamed of, a way out of the endless physiological spiral that keeps me trapped.</p>

<p>I want to press it. I want to be free.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>I was sixteen, sitting cross-legged on my bedroom floor, the Tylenol bottle cool and smooth in my hands. It was a surprisingly small bottle for something so final.</p>

<p>My mind was quiet for the first time in months, no more racing thoughts or nagging self-doubt. Just one simple certainty: I didn’t want to feel this way anymore. I didn’t want to feel anything anymore.</p>

<p>I unscrewed the cap, tipped the pills into my palm, and swallowed them all, one by one, with a glass of water. No tears. No second thoughts. Just the hope that I could slip away unnoticed like a shadow fading at sunset.</p>

<p>What the doctors didn’t tell me that night was how acetaminophen poisons the body. The liver tries to break it down, but in high doses, it creates a toxic byproduct called NAPQI. In small doses, the body can neutralize it. When I had overwhelmed the system, NAPQI built up, overwhelming the liver’s detoxification pathways. It’s a quiet collapse—an organ shutting down piece by piece. It’s slow. It’s quiet.</p>

<p>The medical team moved quickly, their gloved hands methodical as they hooked me up to IV fluids. They countered my self-destruction with cold, mechanical precision, replenishing my glutathione reserves and saving my life.</p>

<p>And now here I am, years later, supposedly at the threshold of something bright: college, independence, and opportunity. But most days, it feels like I’m still trapped in survival mode. My mind cycles endlessly—anxiety and ADHD locked in a brutal tug-of-war, each pulling me in opposite directions.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Anxiety overwhelms. ADHD fragments. Together, they wage war, pulling me between hyperactivity and paralysis, urgency and inaction.</p>

<p>Clinically, my ADHD is described as a deficit in dopamine and an underactive prefrontal cortex. Neuroscientists call it a “dopaminergic deficiency,” a brain chemistry imbalance that makes focus feel insurmountable.</p>
<p>I tell myself to focus; just get through one chapter, one page, even one sentence.</p>

<p>My foot begins tapping, my knee bounces, and my fingers drum on the table. I shift in my seat, sit cross-legged, stand up, and then pace. I stretch my arms, crack my knuckles, and scratch at an itch on my neck that doesn’t exist. Every inch of me feels electrified, and uncomfortable, as if my own skin doesn’t quite fit. I glance at the clock, wondering how much time has passed.</p>

<p>Two minutes.</p>

<p>I stare down at the same sentence, willing myself to read it, to comprehend it, but the words slip away. Each one blurs into the next until they’re just meaningless shapes on the page. My mind leaps to random thoughts—what if I rearrange my desk? Did I leave my window open? Should I check my phone, just for a second? Before I realize it, I’m halfway across the room, reorganizing a drawer I haven’t touched in months.</p>

<p>On a good day, this cycle only lasts an hour. On a bad day, I’ll spend the entire afternoon jumping from one thing to another, flitting between tasks, each one unfinished. I might try switching subjects—maybe calculus will feel easier than chemistry, or maybe biology will hold my attention. But every time, it’s the same story: I end up skimming half a page before I’m drawn away by another restless impulse.</p>

<p>It’s as if my brain is hardwired to reject anything that requires sustained effort. My thoughts scatter in a hundred directions, chasing every fleeting distraction, each one promising something new, something stimulating, but never delivering. I want to study, I really do, but it feels like trying to hold water in my hands—the harder I try, the faster it all slips through my fingers.</p>

<p>I can’t help but wonder why it’s so easy for other people. They can sit down, open a book, and just… read. They don’t have to fight their own bodies just to stay in one place, or beg their minds to stay on task. I watch my classmates sit for hours, calmly working through their assignments, and wonder why I can’t do the same.</p>

<p>Why is it so easy for everyone else? Why does sitting down, opening a book, and just reading feel impossible for me?</p>

<p>I look back at the petition for medical leave, my cursor hovering over the Submit button. I’ve been here before. Spiraling. Drowning. Unraveling.</p>

<p>A message lights up my phone:<br>
“mayyyyy, can’t wait to be in orgo with you next sem, it’s defo gonna be horrific but at least it will be together!”</p>

<p>One word stands out: <strong>together</strong>.</p>

<p>I close the petition and shut my laptop. My fingers tremble as I type back: “Yes. We got this tg.”</p>

<p>It’s a small promise, but it’s enough. For now, it’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>PART II</strong></p>

<p>The diagnosis came a year later. ADHD. Anxiety. Neurotransmitter deficits.</p>

<p>The words weren’t just clinical—they were liberating. Hearing them for the first time was like someone unlocking a door I’d been pounding on my whole life.</p>

<p>It wasn’t laziness. It wasn’t weakness. It wasn’t stupidity. It was biochemistry.</p>

<p>Most of all, it wasn’t my fault.</p>

<p>For years, I saw myself as the problem. I told myself I wasn’t motivated enough, smart enough, disciplined enough to succeed. Each unfinished assignment, each blank stare at a textbook became proof of my failure. As a pre-med student, every slip-up piled onto the crushing pressure of competition.</p>

<p>I hated myself. My parents, immigrants fleeing the military regime in Burma, had sacrificed everything for me, and every bad grade felt like a betrayal. I wasn’t just failing myself—I was failing them, wasting what they had fought so hard to give me.</p>

<p>The diagnosis didn’t erase that guilt overnight, but it shifted the weight. It gave me something solid to hold onto, something that made sense. My struggles weren’t moral failings—they were biological facts. That knowledge didn’t make life easier, but it made the shame bearable.</p>

<p>The medication helped. Zoloft dulled the sharp edges of my anxiety. When I took Adderall, it felt like someone had fine-tuned the radio in my head. The static cleared. My thoughts were in orderly lines, rather than marbles bouncing around in my head. I sat down to study, and for the first time, the work didn’t feel impossible. Tasks that once took hours now took minutes. Before, I could barely focus for thirty minutes without distraction; now, I could manage three, even four hours.</p>

<p>I wasn’t fighting my own brain.</p>

<p>But medication isn’t magic. Some days, I have severe anxiety attacks and my body still fidgets. I get overwhelmed. The difference now is that I have tools. I know when to step back, how to break tasks into pieces, and how to use timers and systems that work with me instead of against me.</p>

<p>Oddly, I’m grateful for the years I spent unmedicated. They forced me to build coping skills, to learn how to keep going even when the chaos felt unbearable. It’s like running with weights—when the load finally lightens, you realize just how strong you’ve become.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>ADHD and anxiety aren’t puzzles you solve; they’re landscapes you navigate. They shape the way I think, feel, and engage with the world, a reality as exhausting as it is inescapable. Yet, over time, I’ve learned to live with their edges, to embrace them as an integral part of who I am.</p>
<p>I’ve stopped comparing my path to everyone else’s. I used to measure myself against their effortless discipline, but now I celebrate the progress I’ve made on my terms.</p>

<p>I’ve learned to give myself grace. To let go of the idea that I need to be perfect, or even “normal.” My mind isn’t built for perfection; it’s built for persistence. I don’t need to be flawless to succeed.</p>

<p>There are still hard days—days when the chaos returns as the weight of pre-med expectations presses down. But there are also moments of quiet pride when I look at how far I’ve come and realize I’m stronger than I ever imagined.</p>

<p>For years, I thought I didn’t belong—anywhere. Not in a pre-med program, not in a college, not in my own body. I thought I was broken, a failure, a mistake.</p>

<p>Now, I understand that I’m none of those things. I’m human. I’m a work in progress.</p>

<p>Anxiety and ADHD are part of my story, but they don’t define me. They’re challenges, not character flaws. And they’ve made me stronger, more adaptable, and more determined than I ever thought I could be.</p>

<p>Four years ago, I didn’t think I’d live to see seventeen. Today, I’m twenty and still standing. Still studying. Still fighting.</p>

<p>I don’t know exactly where this path will take me, but I know this: these four years aren’t borrowed. They’re mine.</p>

<p>And I’ll make them count.</p>
