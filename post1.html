  <h1>they tell me love comes when i least expect it</h1>

  <p><em>jan 14 2025</em></p>

  <blockquote>
    they tell me that love comes when i least expect it.
    fuck that.
    love will come when it’s meant to.
  </blockquote>

  <p>that’s why i’ve stopped expecting it at all. that’s why i bury myself in textbooks, poring over every microscopic detail of the human heart...</p>

  <hr />

  <p>that’s why i pile on back-to-back hospital shifts, running from one patient’s room to the next, letting the constant, frantic urgency of saving someone else’s life silence the screaming void inside my own.</p>

  <p>but sometimes, shit sometimes, i stop. just for a second. on the drive home, when the city is too quiet and the moon hangs heavy and low...</p>

  <blockquote>
    and then people—oh, the audacity of people—have the nerve to say,
    “don’t worry, love will come at the right time.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>i didn’t come into this world waiting. i came out of the womb prematurely, lungs screaming like i already knew the world wasn’t ready for me...</p>

  <p>let me raise a fat middle finger to the universe and keep grinding.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>because i’m single. i’ve been single for most of my life...</p>

  <p>until it wasn’t. until the thrill started wearing off...</p>

  <p>afterward, i rip myself to fucking shreds...</p>

  <blockquote>
    am i not enough?
    am i too much?
  </blockquote>

  <p>i just want someone to tell me that they see me. not just the pieces i choose to show...</p>

  <p>and honestly, why the fuck do heads fit so perfectly in the nooks of shoulders?</p>

  <hr />

  <p>my friends. the ones with their perfect little relationships...</p>

  <p>people say you’re a mosaic of the people you’ve loved before, and they’re not wrong...</p>

  <blockquote>
    so why do i still feel so fucking empty?
  </blockquote>

  <p>and so i keep running. i keep listening to the same goddamn sad love songs on repeat...</p>

  <p>love doesn’t get to show up on its own terms, waltzing into my life when it feels like it...</p>

  <p>so, no. i don’t sit around waiting for “the right time.” i bury myself in my work...</p>

  <p><strong>but i’m not okay. and i know it.</strong></p>
