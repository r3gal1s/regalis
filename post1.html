  <h1>they tell me love comes when i least expect it</h1>
  <p><em>ha. you’re funny</em></p>
  <p>some people be pissing me off</p>
  <p>they tell me that love comes when i least expect it. fuck that. love will come when it’s meant to. when it’s fucking meant to? what the fuck is that supposed to mean? like love is some cosmic delivery service that’ll show up when the stars decide i’ve “earned” it? like i’m supposed to sit here, twiddling my goddamn thumbs, smiling politely while the universe takes its sweet-ass time? nah. fuck your divine timing. fuck your “it’ll happen when you least expect it” bullshit.

that’s why i’ve stopped expecting it at all. that’s why i bury myself in textbooks, poring over every microscopic detail of the human heart: its chambers, its rhythms, its fragile, goddamn deceitful fragility as if memorizing how it works will somehow fix the gaping hollow in my own. 

that’s why i pile on back-to-back hospital shifts, running from one patient’s room to the next, letting the constant, frantic urgency of saving someone else’s life silence the screaming void inside my own. so i sit in my apartment and fill the silence with music so loud it rattles the windows, pretending the pounding bass lines are enough to drown out my thoughts. i highlight the margins of microbiology textbooks until my highlighters run dry, pretending the fluorescent glow of exam rooms and the sterile sting of antiseptic are enough to keep me grounded. i scrub my hands until the skin is raw, pretending that if i just keep moving, just keep working, i’ll be okay. i tell myself this is enough. that i don’t need more. 

but sometimes, shit sometimes, i stop. just for a second. on the drive home, when the city is too quiet and the moon hangs heavy and low, or when i catch my own hollow, exhausted eyes staring back at me in the rearview mirror, i feel it. that ache. it doesn’t just sit there quietly, like it usually does. it rises up, sharp and violent, clawing at the inside of my ribs like it’s trying to rip its way out. i tell myself it’s nothing. hunger, exhaustion, stress. but i know better. it’s all the things i’ve buried alive. it’s everything i’ve forced into silence, screaming to be let out.

and then people—oh, the audacity of people—have the nerve to say, “don’t worry, love will come at the right time. in divine timing.” divine timing? what the fuck does that even mean? well, fuck your divine timing.

i didn’t come into this world waiting. i came out of the womb prematurely, lungs screaming like i already knew the world wasn’t ready for me. at the 99th percentile for weight and height, mind you. i’ve never been one to wait. not for love, not for anything. love doesn’t get to stroll into my life when it’s “meant to.” not after i’ve fought tooth and nail for every inch of myself. not after i’ve built walls so high they could scrape the fucking sky. not after i’ve carved my heart into something unrecognizable and traded it for sutures, gauze, and the cold, unfeeling certainty of an aed shock.

let me raise a fat middle finger to the universe and keep grinding. let me drown in the endless rhythm of saving strangers while pretending i don’t need saving myself. let me bleed out into my work, because at least that feels like it matters.

because i’m single. i’ve been single for most of my life. the longest i ever held onto someone was six months, and even that felt like i was gripping a pile of sand while it poured out through the cracks in my fingers. i’ve fucked around. i’ve slept with people. i’ve had my fun. i’ve kissed strangers at parties, let their hands crawl over my body, let their lips press against my skin, and i fucking loved it. i felt sexy. i felt in control. i wanted it, so i took it. there was no shame. no guilt. it was mine, and it was great.

until it wasn’t. until the thrill started wearing off. until i started waking up next to someone and feeling nothing but the weight of my own goddamn emptiness. i outgrew it. at least i think i did. it’s not like there was some big, dramatic moment where i realized i was done. no, it was slow. messy. ugly. a fucking train wreck of feelings i didn’t know how to process. sometimes i still slip.  sometimes i see a guy across the room, and he’s just a little too good-looking, and the loneliness in me gets too loud. and i think, fuck it. i let him take me. i let myself fall right back into the patterns i swore i left behind. and afterward? 

afterward, i rip myself to fucking shreds. for being weak. for being stupid. for not walking the fuck away 
and now i can’t stop asking myself—is this it? is this why men don’t look at me like i’m “girlfriend material”? like i’m someone worth staying for? eight. that’s my body count. eight people in three years. two a semester. one every few months. does that make me dirty? used up? some disposable fling who’s only good for a fuck and nothing else? am i just the girl you have fun with for a little while and then leave behind when you want someone “serious”?

because that’s what they do. they always fucking leave. they smile, tell me i’m “fun,” tell me i’m “amazing,” tell me i’m “different”—and then they find someone else. someone softer. someone easier to handle. someone who doesn’t come with all my messy, jagged edges. and i’m left sitting there, ripping myself apart like, why the fuck not me? what’s wrong with me? am i not enough? am i too much?

i just want someone to tell me that they see me. not just the pieces i choose to show, not just the strong, polished version of me that i present to the world, but the messy, tangled, complicated whole. i want someone to look at the chaos inside my brain, all the knots and snarls, and untie them softly. no rush, no judgment. just patience and quiet understanding. i want to be loved. but not just loved—loved softly. gently. i want someone to brush the hair from my face, like it’s the most natural thing in the world, their touch so light it’s almost reverent. i want his thumbs to roll over my knuckles absentmindedly, like it’s second nature, like it’s a habit he’s picked up without even realizing it, a silent reassurance that i’m there, and he’s there, and we’re there together.  

and honestly, why the fuck do heads fit so perfectly in the nooks of shoulders? who designed that? why does it feel so natural, so right to rest your head against someone, to let the world disappear for a moment while you just exist together? why do fingers interlock so perfectly, like puzzle pieces, like they were made for it? it’s so stupidly beautiful that it almost makes me angry. i want that. i want someone who feels like home. someone who can make me believe, even for a second, that love doesn’t have to hurt, that love doesn’t have to be loud or dramatic or complicated—it can just be. soft and warm, like sunlight filtering through curtains on a lazy morning. i want that, and i hate that i want it, because it feels pathetic. it feels desperate. like some childish fantasy i should’ve grown out of by now. a dream i’ll never get to wake up into because people like me don’t get that kind of happiness. and yet, no matter how much i hate myself for it, i still want it. i still catch myself hoping. hoping that somewhere out there is someone wondering the same damn thing, someone waiting to take my hand and unravel this mess i’ve turned myself into. someone to hold me and make the world feel a little less cold.

my friends. the ones with their perfect little relationships. their cozy date nights, their matching pajamas, their cheesy instagram captions about how lucky they are to have found “their person.” i smile at them. i say i’m happy for them. but inside? inside i’m burning. inside, it feels like my chest is full of acid, bubbling and boiling and searing me from the inside out. why not me? what’s so wrong with me? what the fuck do they have that i don’t? haven’t i worked hard enough? haven’t i bled enough? how many more hoops does the universe want me to jump through before i get what they have? 

people don’t stay, i remind myself. they never do. am i not worth staying for? am i just the girl who walks into people’s lives, paints their world in bright, vibrant colors, and then watches them leave with every color i gave them?
but then, it’s like no, they do stay. my friends care. i know they do. and god, i love my friends. i love them. i brag about them constantly. i tell everyone i meet how brilliant, how kind, how utterly amazing they are. i talk about different friends with other friends, and i ramble about how amazing they are, like they’re these rare, brilliant people that i can’t believe i get to know. i am so grateful to have people in my life that i just want to emulate. 

people say you’re a mosaic of the people you’ve loved before, and they’re not wrong. i braid my hair the way a girl in the third grade taught me because it made me feel pretty for the first time in my life. i write in capital letters because someone i admired did it, and it looked cleaner, neater—better. i pause between my words and gesture with my hands when i speak because one of my closest friends does it, and i look to my friend for fashion and makeup advice because shes just so fucking cool. i’m kinder to people because i have a friend who radiates kindness, who wouldn’t hurt a fly, who makes me want to be better simply by existing in her orbit. and i know i wouldn’t be the person i am without my friends. i know that. they’ve shaped me, built me, poured themselves into me when i didn’t deserve it. they’ve loved me in ways i can’t even articulate. 

so why do i still feel so fucking empty? why does this ache still sit in my chest, hollow and endless, like a pit i’ll never be able to climb out of? why do i feel like i’m constantly running on fumes, like i’m missing something fundamental? i almost hate myself for it, you know? for feeling this way. for daring to feel this way. like, who the fuck am i to want more when i already have so much? i’m surrounded by people who care about me, who see me, who show up for me in all the ways that matter and yet, here i am, still chasing this abstract, fucking stupid idea of love. like some kind of cosmic idiot. why isn’t it enough? why am i not enough for myself?

and so i keep running. i keep listening to the same goddamn sad love songs on repeat, like they’ll somehow make the ache in my chest easier to carry. they don’t. they never do. they just remind me of everything i don’t have, everything i’ll probably never have, and it hurts. it hurts in that hollow, gnawing way that never really goes away. but what choice do i have? this is the hand i’ve been dealt. this is the life i’ve been given. hope’s a cruel thing. it keeps you going just enough to make you think there’s a chance, but not enough to actually get you anywhere. and i hate that i’m still holding onto it, even now. because i don’t think i know how to let it go.

love doesn’t get to show up on its own terms, waltzing into my life when it feels like it. not after i’ve clawed my way through every fucking obstacle the universe has thrown at me. not after i’ve bled and broken myself just to keep going. not after i’ve fought like hell to survive in a world that doesn’t give a single shit about me.

so, no. i don’t sit around waiting for “the right time.”  i bury myself in my work. i throw myself into hospital shifts, running from one patient to the next, saving other people because it’s easier than trying to save myself. i come home, blast music so fucking loud it shakes the walls, trying to drown out the screaming silence in my head. i highlight textbooks until my hands cramp and the ink dries up, hoping the fluorescent streaks will somehow keep me grounded. i scrub my hands until they sting and bleed, pretending that if i just keep moving, just keep doing, i’ll be okay. i tell myself the reason why i reach for someone is because im not busy enough. because i have too much free time so i think and desire unnecessary things. 

but i’m not okay. and i know it.
