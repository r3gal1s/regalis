  <p>it began, as all the most delicate things do, in a way so unassuming i nearly missed it. the way he walked beside me, his long strides adjusting ever so slightly to match my own. a trifling gesture, one might think, yet in a world where i am so often expected to keep pace with others, the simple act of being met in stride felt like the smallest, softest revolution.  
</p>

  <p>he reached the door ahead of me. i had grown used to holding doors for others, to carving my own path without waiting for a hand to guide it. and yet, when he stepped forward to pull it open, he made no spectacle of it. his hand rested briefly on the frame, and he looked back at me, as though this was simply the way things should be.
</p>
  <p>inside, we sat opposite one another at a small table, the low hum of the restaurant cocooning us in a world of our own. without a word, he took his phone from his pocket and turned it off, placing it somewhere unseen. the faint click of the button was a sound so fleeting, so inconsequential, yet it seemed to hang in the air between us. 
</p>
  <p>his head tilted, his chin resting in the palm of his hand, and his eyes were a warm shade of brown—so earnest, so impossibly open. 
</p>
  <div class="indented">
          <p>“do you always talk with your hands?” he asked, a flicker of amusement tugging at his lips. he gestured lightly in imitation of me, a small arc in the air with his fingertips, his grin widening as i caught myself mid-motion.
</p>
          <p>“do i?” my hands stilled instantly. </p>
          <p>“don’t stop.” he shook his head, his smile softening into something quieter. “it suits you.”</p>
          <p>and so i didn’t.</p>
</div>
  
  <p>there was something about the way he asked questions. he didn’t merely inquire about details but rather sought to understand what lay beneath them. the conversations unraveled in layers, his curiosity gentle but relentless, as though he wished to piece together the tapestry of who i was thread by thread. 
</p>
  <p>when i spoke of qing dynasty dresses, of the intricate embroidery and the elegance of their long, sweeping sleeves, he didn’t interrupt. when i paused to catch my breath, his brow lifted faintly, his lips curving into the smallest of smiles. 
</p>
  <p>the air outside bit at my skin, sharp and cool, but i was too distracted by the glow of streetlamps reflecting off the wet pavement to notice at first. when the breeze picked up, i felt the chill seep in. my hand slipped, without thought, into the crook of his arm. 
</p>
  <p>at the street corner, he paused. his eyes tracing the outline of my face in the soft glow of a streetlamp.  
.</p>
  <p>“may i?” he asked, his voice quiet.  
</p>
  <p>i barely nodded before his lips found mine, tentative at first, as though testing the waters. when i kissed him back, i felt him smile—soft against my mouth—and his hand found its place gently at my waist.  
</p>
  <p>“you don’t care if people see us?” i asked when we pulled apart, the faint rumble of passing cars the only sound between us.  
</p>
  <p>“i’m kissing a pretty girl,” he said, his voice low, steady. “i want them to see us.”  
</p>
   <p>when the uber arrived, he moved ahead of me once again, his hand resting on the top of the doorframe as he held it open. i ducked into the car. 
</p>
   <p>he slid in beside me, and when he noticed my hands tucked into my sleeves against the cold, he reached for one.  
</p>
   <p>“here,” he said softly, cradling it between both of his. his palms were rough and warm, marred by faint callouses that felt like a thousand untold stories. i ran my fingertips absently across them, tracing them like seams. i wondered where they had come from, what they had built, what they had held. when he lifted my hand to his lips, pressing the faintest kiss to my knuckles, i felt a stillness settle in me, quiet and sure.  
</p>
   <p>we kissed again in the backseat, the car moving through the night like a silent witness. the  city’s lights spilled through the window in blurred streaks—gold and white, bleeding like watercolors into the dark. the driver said nothing, though i could feel the faint hum of his disapproval. 
</p>
   <p>when we reached my house, i fumbled for my keys, the chilled metal slipping between my fingers, but even that moment felt stretched, suspended in the stillness around us.
</p>
   <p>at the bottom of the steps leading to my door, he paused. his hand found mine, thumb brushing against my knuckles as though he was considering something, his eyes fixed on me with that unhurried weight that made me feel like the only thing worth noticing.
</p>
   <p>and we stayed like that, at the foot of my house, kissing like teenagers with nowhere else to be—no curfews, no responsibilities beyond the circle of his arms around me and the world we built in the space between us. my back pressed gently against the door, and i melted into the weight of him, his touch steady and constant, like the earth beneath my feet. the wind crept in, sharper now, curling around my bare shoulders, but then he shifted, moving to wrap his trench coat around me in one smooth motion.
</p>
   <p>the fabric smelled like him—faintly of cologne and something else that i couldn’t name but that felt so deeply his. he folded the coat around me, his hands lingering at my shoulders for just a moment longer than necessary, as though anchoring me there, with him.
</p>
  <div class="indented">
  <p><em>“you’re freezing,” he murmured, tucking a strand of hair behind my ear.</em></p>
    <p><em>“i’m fine now.”</em></p>
    <p><em>““you say that,” he said, his lips twitching into something small and amused, “but you’re shaking.”.</em></p>
    <p><em>“maybe it’s not the cold.”</em></p>
    <p><em>at that, he grinned. “fuck, i can’t wait for thursday to come.”</em></p>
  </div>
  
   <p>thursday arrived, and despite every reasonable excuse, despite the fact that the date was at his place, he still showed up at my door. i opened it to find him standing there, a little breathless as though he’d hurried, one hand already moving to smooth his coat.
</p>
   <p>“you didn’t have to pick me up,” i said, though i couldn’t hide the smile that curved my lips. he shrugged lightly, as though the act itself were inevitable. “i wanted to.”
</p>
   <p>inside, he helped me slip out of my coat, his hands careful at my shoulders, peeling the fabric away with deliberate ease before hanging it up. there was something reverent about the way he moved—how he helped without making it feel like help at all, just another way to be with me, to see me.
</p>
   <p>and then we were on the couch, legs tangled, our breaths mingling as the distance between us disappeared entirely. his mouth was on mine, slow at first, his hand firm at my waist.
</p>
   <p>“get on top of me,” he murmured between kisses, his voice low and soft in a way that sent a shiver up my spine.</p>
   <p>i froze, my lips still against his, and then pulled back just enough to look at him. “no,” i said, shaking my head slightly. “i’m too heavy.”</p>
   <p>he raised a brow, his expression incredulous, and his hand brushed against my cheek like he couldn’t quite believe i’d said it. “listen,” he began, his voice a mix of fondness and amusement, “i’m six foot and two hundred pounds. if you punched me, it wouldn’t hurt.”
</p>
   <p>before i could protest again, his hands found my waist, firm but gentle as he lifted me with the kind of ease that stole the air from my lungs. in one smooth motion, he set me down, settling me on top of him like i weighed nothing at all.
</p>
   <p>“see?” he murmured, his hands still on my waist, holding me there like i belonged. his eyes met mine then—steady, unguarded, brimming with that quiet certainty i’d come to recognize in him. “i’ve got you.”
</p>
   <p>there was nothing left to say after that, so i kissed him again, feeling the heat of his palms as they spread across my back, pressing me down against him until there was no space left to fill.
</p>
  <hr />
  
   <p>on my birthday, i wore a dress that shimmered in the light, it clung to everything it touched—my skin, my hair, the air around me—as though it refused to be forgotten. he arrived in a navy suit so sharp and perfectly tailored it looked like something out of a dream—elegant, impossibly expensive, the kind of suit meant to intimidate. but on him, it softened, undone by the way his hair fell slightly out of place. 
</p>
   <p>he came early. i lay sprawled on my bed; i twisted the strands of his hair absently between my fingertips, and he hummed, low and content, the sound vibrating softly against my skin. his eyes drifted closed, his breath steady and warm against my collarbone, and for a moment, i wondered if he might fall asleep right there.
</p>
   <p>when he finally looked up, his brown eyes met mine, and there was something in them—something soft and golden, like sunlight caught in a glass jar. it held me there, anchored and weightless all at once. my gaze followed the slope of his nose, the faint curve of his lips, and i realiz- 
</p>
   <p>	“is there something on my face?” he said with a knowing smirk.
</p>
   <p>i kissed him instead of answering, pressing my lips to his in a way i hoped would quiet the knowing glint in his eyes. i assumed that was answer enough.
</p>
   <p>by the end of the evening, his navy suit had become something else entirely. glitter dusted the lapels, clinging stubbornly to the fabric where my dress had brushed it. it settled in the folds of his sleeves, across the broad planes of his chest, and even faintly along the line of his jaw. he wore it like it belonged there, like it wasn’t an annoyance but a detail.
</p>
   <p>we stayed close the entire night. his hand rested on my waist, his fingers pressing lightly through the thin fabric of my dress as though he needed the anchor. when we sat, his hand found its place on my leg, just above my knee, his thumb tracing small, absentminded circles against my skin. we couldn’t seem to leave each other’s orbit for more than a moment, and when i caught a glimpse of his lips in the dim light, faintly smudged with red, i knew i was to blame for that, too.
</p>
   <div class="indented">
          <p>“oh my god, i’m so sorry—the glitter’s everywhere,” i said, reaching for his lapel, my fingers brushing the shimmering specks.
</p>
          <p>but he stopped me, his hand catching mine and holding it steady. “don’t,” he murmured, his voice soft. his eyes flicked down to where our hands met, then back to mine. “i don’t mind.” 
</p>
</div>
   <p>days later, i ran into some of my friends, and it was through them that i heard the rest of the story.  </p>
   <p>“we told him, ‘that glitter’s going to be a nightmare to get out,’” one of them said with a laugh. “and you know what he said? he just shrugged and went, ‘it’s may’s glitter. i like it.’”  
</p>
  <p>i froze as they spoke, my heart catching in my chest. he hadn’t told me himself. there had been no performance, no showmanship in the way he’d said it. he hadn’t even meant for me to know.</p>

<p>when he gave me my birthday gift, he held out a small box, the edges tied neatly with a thin ribbon, and when i opened it, my breath caught.</p>

<p>inside were two earrings—blue lotuses, delicate and impossibly intricate. i brushed my fingers over the petals, tracing the faint swirls of white and blue enamel. they were so beautiful it almost hurt, but it wasn’t the craftsmanship that stopped me. it was the color—the shade so perfectly matched to a pair of converse i had custom-ordered for myself months ago. shoes he had never seen. shoes i had never even mentioned to him.</p>

<p><em>“how did you…”</em> my voice trailed off as i looked up at him.</p>

<p>he shrugged, his smile tinged with faint embarrassment. <em>“i didn’t know,”</em> he admitted. <em>“i just thought it looked like something you’d like.”</em></p>

<p>he had no idea, and yet he had gotten it exactly right.</p>

<p>as the night went on, voices got louder, glasses tipped more and the room buzzed with an energy only champagne could bring. i had stepped away from him for just a moment, drawn into a quick conversation with an old friend. i was mid-laugh when it happened.</p>

<p>the voice was loud and cheerful, slightly slurred at the edges. i turned to see a friend—well-meaning but drunk, unsteady on his feet—staggering toward me. his grin was wide, boyish, and his arms were already reaching for me before i could process what was happening.</p>
<p>his arm landed heavily across my shoulders, his weight pressing into me in a way that felt clumsy and too close. the laughter caught in my throat as i tried to shift, to make space for myself without making a scene.</p>

<div class="indented">
  <p><em>“hey, happy birthday!”</em> he crowed, his breath carrying the sharp tang of alcohol. he gave me a little shake, a playful gesture that sent me stumbling half a step forward. <em>“you having fun?”</em></p>

  <p>i laughed, but it was tight, forced, my hands moving to gently pry his arm off me. <em>“yeah, i’m—uh—great, thanks. you good?”</em></p>
</div>

<p>before i could pull away completely, i felt it.</p>

<p>his hand, which had been resting lightly at my waist all night, tightened. not harshly, not in a way anyone else would notice, but enough that i felt it—solid and deliberate, a quiet promise in the press of his fingers.</p>

<p>he didn’t move quickly or dramatically. there was no sharpness to his actions, no tension in his face as he stepped closer. but i felt him shift, his presence growing larger somehow, filling the space between me and my friend without making a single sound. he didn’t pull me back, didn’t shove anyone aside. he simply moved.</p>

<div class="indented">
  <p><em>“you good, man?”</em> he said, his voice calm and even, cutting cleanly through the noise of the party.</p>
</div>

<p>my drunk friend blinked, startled by the voice that came from just over my shoulder. my friend’s arm slipped from around me, hanging awkwardly at his side as he turned to look at him.</p>

<div class="indented">
  <p><em>“yeah, yeah, all good!”</em> he stammered, a sheepish laugh bubbling up as he took half a step back. <em>“sorry, didn’t mean to…”</em> he trailed off, waving vaguely before stumbling away in search of another drink.</p>
</div>
<p>the entire exchange couldn’t have lasted more than a few seconds, but the way his hand stayed steady against me—unchanging, unyielding—made it feel like time had bent around us.</p>

<p>when my friend was gone, his hand relaxed. the pressure eased, his fingers softening until they rested lightly again, a touch as unobtrusive as it was grounding. he didn’t say anything right away, didn’t comment or ask if i was okay. he just stood there, his body still angled slightly toward mine, his thumb brushing absentmindedly over my side in a rhythm so gentle i wasn’t sure he realized he was doing it.</p>

<p>finally, he leaned in, his voice low enough that it didn’t carry past the two of us. <em>“you okay?”</em></p>

<p>i nodded, my laugh coming easier this time. <em>“yeah.”</em></p>

<p>he studied me for a moment longer, his gaze steady, before nodding himself. <em>“okay,”</em> he said softly, like that was all that mattered.</p>

<p>and that was it. no scene, no confrontation, no dramatic show of possessiveness. just the quiet certainty of him, standing there, his hand at my waist and his presence wrapping around me like a shield i hadn’t asked for but desperately needed.</p>

  <hr>
  <p>it was in the smallest things—the moments that would have seemed insignificant to anyone else but carried the weight of everything.</p>

<p>it was never the grand gestures with him. not once. he didn’t write sonnets or sweep me off my feet with public declarations of love. his affection was quiet, almost imperceptible, like a soft tide that rolled in and surrounded me before i realized i’d been submerged.</p>

<p>love isn’t the loud moments that movies have taught us to wait for. love is in the way someone leans in to hear you when you think no one is listening. it’s the way they hold you when you don’t even realize you’re about to fall. it’s in the glitter they don’t bother brushing off, because it’s yours. it’s in the way they quietly decide, every day, to show up for you—not in showy ways, but in all the ways that matter most.</p>

<p>it’s in the way they hold your hand—not just when you’re strong, but when you’re trembling.</p>

<p>it’s in the way they look at you, like they could live a thousand lives and never tire of the sight of your face.</p>

<p>it’s in the way they see you—not the polished, curated version of yourself you show to the world, but the raw, untidy edges. the messy, unspoken, too-muchness of you. and instead of looking away, they lean in closer.</p>

<p>but i can’t go back.</p>

  <p>now, all i have are the echoes. the faint touch of his hand at my back. the warmth of his palms cradling mine. the sound of his voice in the cold night air.</p>

<p>but what hurts most is that love like his is so easy to overlook. it doesn’t fight for attention; it doesn’t demand to be noticed. it just is. it sits quietly in the background, making space for you, holding you up, filling every crack you didn’t realize was empty.</p>

<p>and if you’re not careful—if you’re not paying attention—it slips away, just as quietly as it arrived.</p>

  <p>it’s strange, looking back now, to realize how love could live so quietly in the space between two people, while its future could die just as softly. he loved me in the smallest ways—so much so that sometimes i wonder if he even knew he was doing it. and maybe that’s why it hurts, why it always will.</p>

<p>because for all those gestures, for all those moments where i thought i’d found something steady and unshakable, it still wasn’t enough.</p>

<p>he wanted something light. something that didn’t ask for weight or permanence. he loved me in fragments, in pieces, in fleeting moments that felt like eternity but were never meant to stretch beyond them. and i wanted something whole.</p>

<p>but as much as he carried pieces of me, i think he knew he wouldn’t keep them.</p>

<p>there was no dramatic ending, no shouting or slamming of doors. there wasn’t even a fight. it was just a conversation, the kind you can feel unraveling as it begins, the kind that makes your chest tighten because you know it’s already over, even if you’re still holding on.</p>

<p>and i sat there, holding all of those small moments he’d given me—his hand at my back, his coat draped over my shoulders, the camera batteries he’d door-dashed because he knew how much it mattered. i held those pieces of him, those pieces of us, and felt them slip through my fingers one by one.</p>

<p>love, i realized, wasn’t always enough.</p>

<p>he wanted something casual—something weightless, something that wouldn’t press against his chest and ask for a future. but i didn’t know how to love like that. i didn’t know how to give only pieces of myself. i wanted to give him everything.</p>

<p>and that was the problem.</p>

<p>sometimes, when i think about him, i think about the glitter. how it clung to his suit, catching the light in tiny bursts, refusing to let go. i think about the way he carried it without brushing it off, as though it didn’t bother him, as though it belonged to him now. but glitter, no matter how beautiful, is temporary. it always fades, no matter how stubbornly it clings.</p>

<p>that’s what we were—beautiful, fleeting, impossible to hold onto.</p>

<p>i wonder if he ever thinks about me, if he ever thinks about the way i smiled across the table at him, my hands moving in excited gestures he told me not to stop making. i wonder if he remembers the way my hand felt in his, cradled between his palms as he kissed my knuckles in the backseat of that uber.</p>

<p>and i wonder if it hurts for him, too, in some small, quiet way.</p>

  <p>but what hurts the most is that he loved me in ways i’ll never forget. in gestures so small they might have gone unnoticed if i hadn’t been paying attention. and yet, he couldn’t love me in the way i needed him to. he couldn’t love me in a way that stayed.</p>

<p>i wanted permanence, and he wanted freedom.</p>

<p>i wanted to be a part of his future, and he wanted to live in the present.</p>

<p>and so he left.</p>

<p>love like his leaves a mark. it doesn’t end cleanly; it doesn’t fade. it lingers in the corners of your memory, in the smallest moments—like the warmth of his hand at the small of your back, or the way he kissed you at your doorstep as if you were the only thing keeping the world turning. it stays with you, not like a scar, but like a bruise—aching, tender, something you feel long after it’s gone.</p>

<p>but if i’m honest, i wouldn’t trade it for anything.</p>

<p>because even though he left, he gave me something i didn’t know i needed. he showed me what it was like to be loved—not in sweeping gestures or fiery passion, but in the quiet, unshakable certainty of the smallest things.</p>

<p>he taught me that love doesn’t have to be loud to be real. that even the softest, gentlest loves can change you. and maybe that’s why it hurts so much—because with him, i wasn’t just loved. i was seen.</p>

<p>and god, i would rather be seen like that once and lose it than never be seen at all.</p>
