  <p>
    There are nights when everything feels like too much. The noise in your head, the ache in your chest, the weight of just staying upright. And somehow, this song finds its way into your headphones and you realize—you’re not the only one who feels this way.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Enough is enough.” Not in a dramatic, final way. But in that quiet, tired whisper of someone who’s held on a little too long. Who’s hoping the universe is listening this time.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve been thinking a lot about the limits of endurance. How sometimes strength isn’t about pushing forward—it’s about letting yourself feel the full weight of it. Admitting you’re not okay. Letting the cracks show.
  </p>

  <p>
    I guess this is one of those nights.
