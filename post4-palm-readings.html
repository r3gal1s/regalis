  <h1>palm readings and prophecies</h1>
  <div class="date">June 4, 2025</div>

  <p>My grandma always had a steady stream of visitors coming in and out of our house. They arrived with wrinkled brows and tight lips—some even with red, swollen eyes that darted around nervously. She would usher them upstairs, where the door would shut behind them, and I would strain my ears, trying to make sense of their hushed, rapid Burmese.</p>

  <p>She was hard of hearing—essentially deaf—so on rare occasions, she would beckon me inside to interpret. I would sit next to her, listening as she took down their birthdates and the exact day of the week they were born, scribbling furiously in her battered notebook. Then, with an almost priestly solemnity, she would start speaking in that low, knowing voice.</p>

  <p>“Burn incense on the third Monday of the month,” she would say. “Put a yellow flower on your shrine.”</p>

  <p>Some people left our house looking relieved, others still stiff with uncertainty. But they always left with their hands pressed together in a grateful, almost desperate, gesture of respect. My grandma was one of the few Burmese fortune tellers in all of New York, and the people who came to her—from factory workers to cab drivers to professors to CEOs—all swore by her words.</p>

  <p>But when it came to me, she refused. <em>"Not until you turn eighteen,"</em> she always said. <em>"Too young. Live your life first."</em></p>

  <p>And so I waited.</p>

  <p>On the night of my eighteenth birthday, after the last of my friends had left and my parents had gone to bed, my grandma finally relented. She had me sit at the dining table across from her, a position that felt oddly formal, almost foreign. Usually, I was the one watching her work from the side, translating or fetching her tea. But now, under the dim glow of the kitchen light, I was the one being studied.</p>

  <p>She took my left palm in her weathered hands, her fingers rough from years of cooking, cleaning, and writing in that tattered notebook of hers.</p>

  <p>For a moment, she just looked.</p>

  <p>She traced the lines lightly, her fingertips cool against my skin. Her brows knitted together as she studied the intricate web of creases. I watched as her lips moved slightly, as if counting.</p>

  <p>Then she reached for her notebook and flipped to a fresh page. She jotted down my birthdate.</p>

  <p><em>“November 28th, 2004,”</em> she murmured, mostly to herself. <em>“7:04 PM. Not AM?”</em></p>

  <p>A strange, creeping feeling coiled in my stomach. <em>“Yeah… PM.”</em></p>

  <p>She nodded, writing something else. Her handwriting was small, cramped, and slanted—something that had always fascinated me as a kid. But as I leaned forward slightly, trying to catch what she was writing, she quickly flipped back a few pages, as if comparing notes from past readings.</p>

  <p>Then, for the first time in my life, I saw her hesitate.</p>

  <p>She looked at my hand again, tracing over one particular line—slowly this time, with more weight. Her jaw tightened. She turned my palm slightly, her thumb pressing down on a spot beneath my pinky.</p>

  <p><em>“Strange,”</em> she muttered.</p>

  <p>My breath caught in my throat. <em>“What?”</em></p>

  <p>She exhaled sharply through her nose.</p>

  <p><em>“Thame,”</em> she said, using my childhood pet name, <em>“your next two years—eighteen and nineteen—will be the hardest years of your life.”</em></p>

  <p>I blinked. <em>“Wait, what?”</em></p>

  <p>She didn’t look at me. She was still staring at my hand, flipping back and forth between my palm and her notes.</p>

  <p>I let out a nervous laugh. <em>“Come on, Grandma, you’re joking, right?”</em></p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>A thick silence hung between us, and I realized my palms were starting to sweat.</p>

  <p><em>“How do you know that?”</em> I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. <em>“From my hand? My birthday?”</em></p>

  <p>She nodded. <em>“Your life line,”</em> she said, tapping a long, deep crease that curved around my pointer finger, <em>“and your Saturn line—this one, right here—are intersecting in a way that…”</em> She trailed off, pressing her lips together.</p>

  <p>I swallowed hard. <em>“In a way that what?”</em></p>

  <p><em>“In a way that shows struggle. Disruption.”</em></p>

  <p>She moved her fingers lower, tracing a faint, broken line. <em>“Here. This shows a period of darkness. Hardship. It will last for two years.”</em></p>

  <p>I pulled my hand back slightly. <em>“Like, what kind of hardship?”</em></p>

  <p>She finally looked up at me, her dark eyes steady, unreadable. <em>“I don’t know exactly. It could be illness, loss, heartbreak. Maybe all of it.”</em></p>

  <p>A chill ran down my spine.</p>

  <p><em>“But it will pass,”</em> she said quickly, sensing my unease. <em>“The line doesn’t end. It only wavers.”</em></p>

  <p>I forced a laugh, shaking my head. <em>“This is crazy. You’re telling me that, just from my hand, you can predict my life is going to suck for the next two years?”</em></p>

  <p>She didn’t blink. <em>“Yes.”</em></p>

  <p>I leaned back in my chair, crossing my arms. <em>“No offense, Grandma, but that’s kind of messed up to say on my birthday.”</em></p>

  <p>She sighed. <em>“Would you rather I lie?”</em></p>

  <p>I didn’t answer.</p>

  <p>I thought about my life—about how bright my future was. I was heading to Cornell, an Ivy League. I had worked my ass off to get there. How could she say that, after everything? How could she be so sure?</p>

  <p>Her gaze softened. <em>“I didn’t want to read for you yet. That’s why I waited.”</em></p>

  <p><em>“What do you mean?”</em></p>

  <p>She sighed again, quieter this time. <em>“Because once you hear something, you cannot unhear it.”</em></p>

  <p>Her words settled over me like a heavy blanket.</p>

  <p>I shook my head. <em>“Well, I don’t believe it.”</em></p>

  <p>She didn’t argue. She just patted my hand, the way she always did when she was done reading for someone. <em>“Then forget it,”</em> she said simply. <em>“It’s only a reading.”</em></p>

  <p>But the way she looked at me told me she knew I wouldn’t. And she was right. I didn’t forget.</p>

  <p>Even when I laughed it off that night, even when I told myself it was nonsense, a small part of me—deep in my bones—already knew.</p>

  <p>And over the next two years, as everything unraveled, boy was she right.</p>
