  <p>There is something unbearably cruel about the stillness of a hospital room. Sitting here, beside my grandmother, I am acutely aware of how the rest of the world carries on. Just beyond the window, life continues. The crows and sparrows are already migrating, their wings slicing through a winter sky streaked with soft gold and bleeding red. They fly as if they know where they’re going—someplace warmer.</p>

  <p>Someplace kinder. I wish I could take her there.</p>

  <p>The sun sinks lower, spilling light through the smudged glass pane. It creeps across the room, bathing the hard edges of this place in a fleeting warmth, like a farewell. For a moment, the hospital bed seems less like a prison, the white sheets shifting to shades of honey and amber. The sun, defiant against time, reaches for her—tries to touch her, to pull her back into the world. But it can’t. It never lasts. The light fades, and the shadows rise, creeping into every corner, settling heavy in the air.</p>

  <p>This room doesn’t belong to the living. The walls feel as though they are holding their breath, waiting for the inevitable. The only sounds are the hiss of the oxygen machine, mechanical and impersonal, and the soft drip of the IV, like a clock counting down in cruel, measured drops. I sit in the chair that has become mine, its cushion flattened by weeks of waiting, its arms polished smooth by hands too restless to stay still. I know the chair’s creak when I shift, the sound of its legs scraping the floor—these are my only constants. I don’t even notice them anymore.</p>

  <p>This is my life now. Here. In this room where time feels suspended and yet moves relentlessly forward. I don’t think of “home” anymore—not the place I go to shower or change clothes or stare at my reflection in the bathroom mirror until I don’t recognize the person looking back. This room is my home. It’s where I sit. Where I watch. Where I wait for the worst thing I can imagine.</p>

  <p>Her chest rises and falls in shallow, uneven gasps. I count her breaths now, because I don’t trust the machines. I’ve stopped trusting anything but the fragile rhythm of her body. The pulse oximeter flashes red again—her oxygen dips below 88. The shrill alarm screams, but I don’t move. I just hold my breath, as if my lungs could lend her strength. As if my silence could keep her here. The machine counts the seconds, and I count them too. One. Two. Three. Each second feels like a lifetime. The number rises to 90. Then 93. Then 96. The alarm quiets, but the relief doesn’t come. It never does.</p>

  <p>This has been our routine for weeks. Days folding into nights, nights folding into days. Time feels shapeless now, a blurry stretch of alarms and numbers and shallow breaths. I want to rage against it. Scream at it. Beg it to stop. But I do none of those things. Instead, I sit here, like I always do.</p>

  <p>She wasn’t supposed to end like this. When my grandmother turned seventy-two, did she ever imagine herself here, tethered to tubes and surrounded by the cold hum of machines? Did she see this room in her future? Did she feel the weight of cancer, like a dark thing spreading its claws through her lungs, her ribs, her blood?</p>

  <p>I don’t think so. I think she imagined something quieter. Something gentler. She wouldn’t have wanted this—this sterile, indifferent place, where her life has been reduced to numbers on a screen and the desperate prayers of a granddaughter who can do nothing but wait.</p>

  <p>Not long ago, she was everything. When I close my eyes, I can still see her in the sunroom, laughing, the light pouring in through the windows and catching on the strands of silver in her hair. I can hear her voice, warm and clear, scolding me for peeking at her cards as she shuffled the deck for another game of Burmese poker. “You little cheat!” she would say, her laughter rising like a bell. I can still smell the turmeric on her apron, the chilies on her hands, as she sang to herself in the kitchen, flipping fish in a cast-iron pan.</p>

  <p>She was the center of the world, my grandmother. She was a woman who believed in signs, in omens, in the pull of the universe. She’d trace the lines of my palm with her weathered fingers and whisper, “You’ll have a long life, my darling. But you must be brave. Do you promise me that?”</p>

  <p>How do I tell her I don’t feel brave now? That I feel like a child again, small and powerless, watching her slip further away from me?</p>

  <p>My mother looks at me sometimes with this quiet desperation, as if my pre-med textbooks from Cornell should hold the answers to questions no one can answer. But they don’t. I know what the chart says. I know the truth. Stage V ovarian. Metastatic. Palliative care. These words follow me everywhere, taunting me in the sterile corridors, chasing me into the too-quiet hours of the night.</p>

  <p>What kind of doctor am I training to be if I can’t even save the woman who raised me?</p>

  <p>I look at her now, and she is so small. Smaller than she’s ever been. The hospital gown hangs loose on her frame, the sharp edges of her bones pushing against her paper-thin skin. Her face is hollowed, her cheeks sunken, her lips pale and cracked. She doesn’t look like my grandmother anymore. She looks like a ghost, something caught between this life and the next, something waiting for permission to leave.</p>

  <p>When my younger cousins visit, they don’t know what to do. They sit quietly, their hands folded in their laps, their wide eyes flickering to the machines, to the tubes, to the woman who doesn’t even have the strength to open her eyes. They don’t cry, but I see the fear in their faces. They don’t know what they’re losing. I envy them for that. But they never got to know her the way I did—the way she used to be. They’ll never remember her laughter shaking the walls, or the warmth of her hands as she braided my hair. They’ll never hear her stories about mango trees and monsoons and a childhood so far away it felt like a dream.</p>

  <p>When they leave, I stay. I always stay. The room grows darker, the sky beyond the window sinking into black. The last of the birds are gone now, their silhouettes swallowed by the horizon. The machines glow softly in the dark, their lights blinking like dying stars.</p>

  <p>I take her hand in mine, and it feels so cold, small, so fragile. I want to hold her tighter, but I’m afraid. Afraid she might break. Or worse—afraid she might not feel it at all.</p>

  <p>“It’s okay,” I whisper, even though nothing about this is okay. Even though I’m not sure who I’m trying to comfort. Her? Myself? The walls?</p>

  <p>Outside, the world moves on. People get in their cars, turn on their lights, laugh over dinner. But not here. Here, the world is still.</p>

  <p>I wait for her to leave me. That is the one truth I can’t escape. And when she does, I can only hope that where she’s going is warm. That the air will be soft, the skies wide and endless, and that she will finally be able to breathe again.</p>

  <p>Someplace better. Someplace beyond the pain.</p>

  <p>The birds are gone. The sky is empty. I sit in the quiet, her hand in mine, listening to the faint hum of the machines and the soft rasp of her breathing.</p>
